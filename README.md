For this Project , we'll need to complete **1 Data Challenges. 

Project Purpose:

Our objective is to build a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, expect to produce the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

We use 
* Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
* Matplotlib library.
